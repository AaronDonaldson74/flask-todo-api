# This app is for a TODO list. It was developed during Bottega classes.

We have created a pip environment. Use command pipshell to enter the environment.

to run the program use the command: python app.py in the command line, and open a browser window localhost:5000.

This uses flask, flask-squalchemy, and flask-marshmallow dependancies.

# Python Flask TODO Api
